# Docker

-   docker uses Containers to run applications in isolated environments with specific dependencies.
-   docker main purpose is to maintain containers

## Virtual machines vs containers

-   VM has its own full operating system running on top of your pc operating system and is typically slower.
-   Containers share the host operating system & typically quicker.

## images

-   blueprint for containers and what they contain :

    -   OS and/or runtime environment
    -   app source code
    -   configuration files ( ex: .env)
    -   commands (for the app to run and work)

-   images are readonly and cannot be modified once they are generated

## containers:

-   containers are runable instances of images
-   they are run in an isolated environment and work independently

## making of images:

-   an image is made of many layers and the layers order matters !

### Parent image :

-   OS and sometimes runtime environment from Dockerhub.

# create images

```
docker build -t imagename (dockerfilelocation)
```

# create container from image

```
docker run --name containername -p TARGET_PORT:EXPOSED_PORT imagename
```

# run container

```
docker start containername
```

# delete all images / containers / images

docker system prune -a
